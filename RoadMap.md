Refined Project Plan

We'll build this in phases so that you can continuously expand it as you go.
Phase 1: Core Setup & Initial Functionality

    Tech Stack:
        Framework: Next.js (App Router for latest features)
        Language: TypeScript
        Styling: Tailwind CSS with dark mode
        Content Management: MDX (Markdown with JSX for interactivity)
        Authentication: Clerk (handles auth, user management)
        Hosting: Initially GitHub Pages, but we can migrate if needed

    Initial Features:
        Homepage (Intro + recent blog posts, projects, and CTF writeups)
        Blog Section (Supports MDX for interactive content)
        Project Portfolio (Showcase projects dynamically)

Phase 2: Enhancements & Cool Features

    Search & Filtering: Implement search across blog posts, projects, etc.
    Interactive Animations:
        Use Framer Motion for smooth page transitions
        Potential react-three-fiber (Three.js in React) for 3D elements
    Dynamic Theming: Allow users (or just you) to switch between color themes
    CMS Experimentation: Evaluate a CMS (e.g., Sanity or Strapi) for easier content management
    Custom Dashboard for Private Notes & Drafts

Phase 3: Expansion & Future Roadmap

    Personal Dashboard: Start building Notion/Jira-style tools
    SEO Optimization & Social Media Integration
    API Integrations: Pull in external data (e.g., cybersecurity feeds, portfolio stats, etc.)
    Advanced Visuals: More 3D elements or WebGL experiments
